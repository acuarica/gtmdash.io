To work with **gtm Dashboard** you will need **gtm** to track your time.
First, install [Git Time Metric](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm) and any of its [plugins](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm#install-a-plugin-for-your-editor) and automatically start tracking your time.
Then you can install **gtm Dashboard**.
Go to [releases](https://github.com/acuarica/gtm-web/releases) and download gtm Dashboard for your operating system.
It will automatically detect your gtm installation, and you can visualize you time data.
