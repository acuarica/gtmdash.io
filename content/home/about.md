Reporting application to visualize [Git Time Metric](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm) time data.

Git Time Metric is an application that lets you track the time you spend working on files in your git repositories.
To store your time data, it uses [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes), which is essentially metadata stored in your git repository.

Git Time Metric Dashboard is an application to visualize your time data.
Keep in mind that this is heavily **work in progress**. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you would like to add any feature,
or you have early feedback.
